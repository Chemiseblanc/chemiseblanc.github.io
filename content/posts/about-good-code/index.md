One of the best ways I’ve found to gauge your experience level in software is to consider the size of work that you can accomplish while still maintaining the level of quality you consider “good code”.

The concept of "good code" varies from person to person and over time, so for this situation I'll define good code as: Code you find understandable, that does not have obvious areas for significant improvement, and could withstand criticism from your contemporaries.

Over time as you gain experience, looking back on your previous work may elicit feelings of shame or embarrassment, but It's important to always look at your old work in the context of the environment it was written in. For example, if you look at code you wrote when making everything object-oriented as in-vogue you may question why you ever thought many-deep nested class hierarchies were a good decision, but in the context of when you wrote it, you were just trying to follow what the best practices of the day considered proper. If you wrote "good code" then it should still be possible to understand and reason about it even if a better way to do it is painfully obvious to you now.

Being able to self-critique is an important skill and going back to judge your code year after year is a great way to see how and where you've gained experience since it doesn't just happen over time. Experience only comes through practice and a desire to improve.
