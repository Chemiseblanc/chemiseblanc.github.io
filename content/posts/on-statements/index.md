Outside of purely functional programming languages, you may have noticed that not all statements  are equal.



1. Old fashioned imperative code,

2. Enterprise Object-Oriented Code,

* First class objects -> leverages statements to methods -> methods to objects

3. First-class functions

* statements -> functions

Without 3, 2 is used to achieve the same effect, but the overhead of which creates design patterns who's purpose is confusing if you are unaware.
