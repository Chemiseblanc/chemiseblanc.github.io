One of the best ways I’ve found to gauge one’s experience level in software is to consider the size of work that can be accomplished while still maintaining the level of quality you consider “good code”.

For me I’ve found this to be around 1k SLOC where I can maintain high quality in a combination of code, documentation, and testing.

For larger projects I can maintain reasonably quality for upwards of 10k SLOC
