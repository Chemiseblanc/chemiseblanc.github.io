<h1>Introducing Latitude</h1>

<p>Hello, World!</p>
<p>I decided to give my long neglected homepage a makeover (ignoring my other long neglected websites) but instead of just picking
something interesting from the <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>Hugo theme list</a> I decided to go all in and make a new theme from scratch.</p>
<p>After looking at some other themes for inspiration I decided to challenge myself and go with the concept of a theme with a horizontally scrolling homepage.
It took a couple days of learning how to correctly massage flexbox into displaying how I wanted I came up with a general design which grew into the theme showing on the website now.</p>
<p>One of my goals was to have a theme that could adapt to different types of posts. Looking at the main types of social media I was familiar with I came up with three categories of content</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortform text posts ie. Twitter</li>
<li>Longform text like traditional blogs</li>
<li>Image posts with or without captions</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of using seperate hugo archetypes for each category I came up with a single template that adapts based off a combination of the content of a post and the supplied metadata.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to keep the theme almost entirely javascript free but I did include a small snippet on the homepage for translating vertical mouse scrolling into horizontal for ease of use.</p>
<p>My plan is to fine tune the theme over the next few weeks but by and large it is essentially complete.</p>
<p>Overall, developing a theme for hugo was very pleasant once I understood the template lookup order and the built in image processing and sass compiler are wonderful to use.</p>
<p>If I were to add anything else it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>better support for defining theme settings</li>
<li>being able to handle SVG files with the image processing, mostly as a pass-through but with a way to integrate minification without treating them as a seperate resource like css</li>
</ul>
