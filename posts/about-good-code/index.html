For example, if you look at code you wrote when making everything object-oriented as in-vogue you may question why you ever thought many-deep nested class hierarchies were a good decision, but in the context of when you wrote it, you were just trying to follow what the best practices of the day considered proper. If you wrote &ldquo;good code&rdquo; then it should still be possible to understand and reason about it even if a better way to do it is painfully obvious to you now.</p><p>Being able to self-critique is an important skill and going back to judge your code year after year is a great way to see how and where you&rsquo;ve gained experience since it doesn&rsquo;t just happen over time. Experience only comes through practice and a desire to improve.</p><a class=section-link href=https://mgibson.ca/posts/>See more in Posts</a></article></main></body></html>
